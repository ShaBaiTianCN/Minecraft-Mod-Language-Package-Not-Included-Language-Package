Autocrafting can happen with any combination of &oitems&r, &ofluids&r and &oenergy&r. The two main parts that are required for this are the &lCrafting Interface&r and the &lCrafting Writer&r.",
  "info_book.integratedcrafting.introduction.text2": "The &lCrafting Interface&r can be placed next to any kind of crafting machine, and can be used to provide crafting options to the network based on &lVariable Cards&r containing &8Recipes&0.",
  "info_book.integratedcrafting.introduction.text3": "The &lCrafting Writer&r can then be used to automatically start crafting jobs based on the recipes that are exposed by all &lCrafting Interfaces&r in the network.",

  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.basics.text3": "When opening the GUI of a &lCrafting Interface&r, you can insert &lVariable Cards&r that hold &8Recipes&0. This will tell the interface that the given recipe can be crafted using the bound machine.",

  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.crafting.text1": "This section will explain how the crafting process is being handled by &lCrafting Interfaces&r. This information is essential to get the most out of this mod, and to debug any issues you may encounter.",
  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.crafting.text2": "When a crafting job is started (for example with the &lCrafting Writer&r), one (or more) &lCrafting Interface(s)&r will be used that have a recipe corresponding to the given job. The &lCrafting Interface&r is responsible for inserting all inputs of the recipe into the bound machine. It will do this based on the storage network contents, as provided by &lIntegrated Tunnels interfaces&r.",
  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.crafting.text3": "A &lCrafting Interface&r will however &lnot&r import the crafting results from the bound machine. The player is responsible for making sure that the crafting results end up back into the network. The Crafting Table is an exception for this, only a &lCrafting Interface&r is required to craft with this. The &lCrafting Interface&r will track changes in the storage network, and it will only mark the crafting job as completed once the expected outputs are present in the storage network. This can be achieved by either placing an active &lIntegrated Tunnels importer&r onto the machine, or by letting the machine automatically output into the &lCrafting Interface&r. Everything (items, fluids, energy) that is inserted into the &lCrafting Interface&r will be inserted into the storage network for the configured channel.",

  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.configuration.text2": "Additionally, you can change the target side separately &ofor each ingredient type&r. This is useful if the bound machine accepts different ingredient types in different sides. For example, items may be accepted from the sides, while fluids may be accepted from the top.",

  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.recipe_feedback.text2": "This is an early-feedback system in cases you accidentally insert the wrong recipe into an interface, for example if you insert the crafting recipe for a chest into a &lCrafting Interface&r that is bound to a furnace.",

For example, this feature allows you to distribute the crafting of 40 iron ingots evenly over 10 furnaces.",
  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.distribution.text2": "The only things that is needed to make this work, is to make sure that all machines that you want to distribute over, have a &lCrafting Interface&r that (at least) expose exactly the same recipe that you want to distribute. In the case of our previous example, you would have to make sure that all 10 furnaces have a &lCrafting Interface&r containing (at least) exactly the same recipe for smelting iron ingots.",

  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.dynamic_recipes.text1": "Following the dynamic nature of &lIntegrated Dynamics&r &lVariable Cards&r, recipes that are exposed through &lCrafting Interfaces&r can also be fully dynamic.

  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_interface.dynamic_recipes.text2": "&lCrafting Interfaces&r will automatically detect when a recipe is updated, and all new crafting jobs will immediately use the new recipe. However, all running crafting jobs will still use the old recipe.",

Visualizing these lists in &lDisplay Panels&r can help you pinpoint the problem you are experiencing.",

  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_writer.text2": "Using the following aspects, you can start crafting jobs for the given recipe, output item, output fluid or output energy. Using the aspect settings, you can configure the crafting channel, whether or not already-running crafting jobs should block any new jobs, if crafting jobs for any missing inputs should also be started, and whether or not the presence of ingredients in the storage network should block any new crafting jobs.",
  "info_book.integratedcrafting.crafting_writer.text3": "If you want to insert a &lVariable Card&r for telling that &onothing&r should be crafted, just insert an empty value, such as a &lVariable Card&r for the &8Item&0 value type without an actual item in it.",

  "info_book.integratedcrafting.tutorials.autocrafting_setup.text3": "Next, we are going to tell the &lCrafting Interface&r how it can craft Oak Planks.
